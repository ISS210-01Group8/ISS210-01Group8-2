                <p> People with disabilities are marginalized on a daily basis. Whether it is from education, employment, or their ability to obtain resources. The population in the world with disability is significantly more likely to become impoverished and unemployed. Employers have a higher tendency to hire someone from the able-bodied community over someone with a disability. We believe that this needs to change. Everyone should have an equal opportunity, to a certain extent, to obtain a job that is suitable for that person. Those with a disability, who want a job, should have the same opportunities when in the search for a job. </p>

                <div class="container"><p>Social Justice refers to fair and equitable division of resources, opportunities, and privileges in society. There is a widespread assumption that disability is not a serious category of oppression in comparison to racism and sexism which is not true. Society is only just when it provides accessible and adequate disability support. People should not stigmatize disabled people's dependency but recognize that everyone is interdependent. Disabled and impaired people have a voice that needs to be heard and listened to in the world around them. 
<br>    The CDC defines a disability as “any condition of the body or mind (impairment) that makes it more difficult for the person with the condition to do certain activities (activity limitation) and interact with the world around them (participation restrictions).” Let's be honest, yes, having a disability limits someone from a large portion of everyday life. However, this does not mean that they are unable to work in any setting. Socioeconomic status is defined as an economic and sociological measure of a person’s work experience and of an individuals or families economic access to resources.
<br>    There are jobs out there that require more skill level than others. When it comes to choosing a job, this is something everyone thinks about. Employers base who they are hiring off of ableness and ability to complete the work. When you think about it, how often do employers overlook someone who has applied that has a disability? Studies show that less than 20% of the people in the US with a disability are employed. 
<br>    Those with disabilities may be paid less than those who are able bodied and they are given less opportunities due to their ailment. This however, does not define how they are able to work. There should be adjustments to help those who are willing to work and employers, when able, should work with everyone on a plan to incorporate the needs of every employee. Employability is an issue within many workplaces. Some individuals try to distance themselves from those who they perceive as disabilities or impaired in hopes of maintaining their own economic independence and personal status. 
>br>    In order to change the percentages of employed persons with disability, employers can work towards an inclusive environment. Being inclusive of everyone, and changing practices based on needs, not only makes someone grow as a person, but elevates the company overall. Being the change in the workforce will drive those with disability (who are willing to work) to a higher socioeconomic status. This, in turn, helps those in need get the resources they need for daily life.

States with a higher rating are more intolerant. The trend clearly shows that states that are more prejudice are less likely to hire disabled people. Therefore, disabled people consistently find it harder to be employed, giving them a socioeconomic disadvantage.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The video begins by discussing the intersectionality of low income groups and those with mental disabilities. Since many schools in low income areas are underfunded one of the first areas the schools cut funding from is special education programs. Moving on to the effects of these schools, the actions taken to cut costs lower quality of life. Outside of the school 29 to 49 percent of a household's income, and since only 1/5 of disabled people work the weight of making that extra money lies on the rest of the family. They then review a story from a woman who was discriminated against because of her blindness, and they comparedthis to racial discrimination. Had this been racial, sexual or any other type of discrimination people would have noticed and cared. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>The American Physiological Association brings attention to the socio economic issues within the disabled community. This includes income, education, financial security, social status, and class. Low socioeconomic status connects to lower educational achievement, poverty, inequality, and insufficient health. This results in twenty six percent of adults in America facing inequality solely based on their disabilities.The American Association of People with Disabilities estimates that roughly two thirds of people with disabilities are of working age and want to work though they do not have access and resources to achieve this. As a result of the high poverty rates among this group there are doubts within society about the insufficient public assistance to these individuals and helping them return to work. Continuing, within education there is a major gap between graduation and obtaining degrees.  According to the 2015 Census, 15.1% of the population twenty five years or above with a disability have acquired a bachelor’s degree or higher, while in comparison 33%of individuals in the same age category with no disability have attained the same educational status (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015) which is twice the amount of individuals with a disability which is shocking. Additionally research on health care and disability shows individuals with a disability face many dilemmas when trying to obtain health care because of accessibility concerns including, transportation, communication barriers, and insurance (Drainoni et al., 2006). In conclusion multiple pieces of evidence are shown to proven the social economic problems the disability community faces.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Socioeconomic status (SES) plays an important role in the health shock of individuals and thus, many nations have started paying attention to prevent the risk of this shock for old adults.

SES has significant impact on the disability of old adults. Specifically, economic conditions (income) plays dominant role. Economic status affects the risk of individual disability mainly through life security and health behavior. Secondly, SES significantly affecting health shock, with education and economic status showing remarkable impact, and there is an apparent group inequality.

SES is an important factor influencing residents’ health shock, and health shocks like cerebral thrombosis and cerebral hemorrhage will indirectly lead to the risk of individual ADL disability. Furthermore, among the multi-dimensional indicators of SES, individual income and education are predominant factors affecting health shock and ADL disability, while occupation of pre-retirement have little impact. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The chart shows the poverty rates between people who have disabilities and people who do not. As it would appear people with disabilities have a 25-30% poverty rate compared to an 11-15% poverty rate for people without a disability. This can be from many different reasons, or multiple at the same time. A lot of medication for people with disabilities is not cheap to buy every time you need it, which adds up to a lot of money needed to be spent on medication alone in one’s life. In addition to that, it could also imply people with disabilities are often marginalized in the workplace, making it difficult for them to have a main source of income. Also, people with disabilities do not get the help they need early on in life which makes life a lot more difficult as they age, taking them out of the workplace and needing more medication, causing them to blow through savings, just to name a few reasons. Also, people with disabilities are more unlikely to find a job if they suffer from a severe disability like blindness or deafness causing them to be dependent on help from another and if that help isn’t present they would live under the poverty line. Lastly, even when people with disabilities are present in the workplace their job is a lot harder to keep than someone without one, because their boss could fire them to make room for a more “qualified person.”</p>
